// 1. Run the code below. What is it doing? How could you modify this code to count to 592?
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  console.log(i);
}

// 2. COUNTDOWN (AKA Top 10 Beyonce Song). What is this code doing? How could you modify this code to countdown from 101?
// for(var i = 10; i > 0; i--){
//   console.log(`COUNTDOWN: ${i}`);
// }


// 3. Printing out a message: Write a for loop that counts up to 322 and tells the user what number you have counted to (e.g. '"I have counted to 1", "I have counted to 2", etc.)




// 3. Log out every number from 50-100



// 4. Log out every even number up to 100




// 5. Log out every multiple of 2 and every multiple of 3 up to 100




// 6. Log out the sum of every number under 1000




// 7. CHALLENGE: Log out the first 10 digits of the fibbonacci series.





// 8. REVIEW: Print out all 5 items in this list. Why does this seem like a lot of work?
var bestBeyonceSongs = ["Crazy in Love", "Love on Top", "Freedom", "Halo", "Get Me Bodied"]



// 9. Add 5 of your favorite songs to the list. Use a for loop to print out each item by saying "I like to listen to Halo", "I like to listen to Crazy in Love", etc.






// 10. BRING IT TOGETHER: I have given you a large list of numbers with scores from a recent project. I have made a typo in everyone's grade and they are too large. Divide each grade my 100 to get the actual grade. Print out the correct value to the console.
var grades = [1891,1975,1987,1923,1928,1993,1946,1947,2005,1897,1971,1929,1875,1945,1680,811,1901,1396,1942,1282,1941,1978,1884,1879,1230,2010,1881,1979,1996,1904,1934,1865,2003,2006,1966,1860,1259,1959,1931,1963,1878,1880,151,1925,1663,1908,1863,1391,1922,1968,1998,1084,1982,1960,1938,1876,1937,1882,1873,1926,1986,1416,1864,1862,1969,1913,532,1866,1242,1933,1903,965,1927,1890,1991,1388,1992,1902,1907,1964,1394,2009,1920,630,1932,1854,1951,1852,1983,1314,1855,1954,1921,1989,1871,1995,1885,1974,1915,1872,1251,1899,1985,1889,1935,1912,946,1965,1739,1973,1911,1910,1917,1918,1900,1886,1477,2000,1916,1077,2004,1456,1867,1970,1999,1919,1726,706,1930,1994,1988,1997,1870,1953,652,1893,1898,1883,1957,1972,1874,1977,1955,2001,1906,1389,1848,1940,1877,1962,1948,1887,1924,1403,1408,1861,1892,1990,1222,677,1392,1113,1085,1894,1106,1939,1961,1944,1952,1643,1404,1895,1958,1976,1206,1905,1076,1888,1896,1943,1950,2008,1967,164,1981,1868,1914,1909,1956,341,1379,2007,1563,1980,1072,1949,1250,1258,1092,2002];




// 11. Double bonus challenge: Check this list above. If the grade listed in the original list is larger than 1800, I want them to be added to the new list called "high grades". Print out the size of this list when the for loop is done
var highGrades = [];
